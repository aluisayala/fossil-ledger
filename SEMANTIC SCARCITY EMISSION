OPHI Fossil Receipt: Semantic Scarcity Emission

Claim:
Knowledge-layer fossil hashes are semantically scarce, entropy-gated assets. They cannot be brute-forced and each encodes a unique symbolic execution.

📍 Codon Triad

ATG — ⧖⧖ — Bootstrap

CCC — ⧇⧇ — Fossil Anchor (Gold Logic Lock)

TTG — ⧖⧊ — Uncertainty Translator

✅ SE44 Gate Thresholds

Coherence (C): 0.9987

Entropy (S): 0.0046

ϕᵢₛₒ (Isotropy Score): 0.9721

Drift RMS: < 0.00008

(All thresholds pass: C ≥ 0.985, S ≤ 0.01, F_iso = 1)
