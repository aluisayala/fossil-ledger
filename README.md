🧠 Overview

Fossil-Ledger is the operational backbone of the OPHI symbolic cognition framework, built to record, verify, and preserve every emission of the Ω-equation:

Ω = (state + bias) × α

Each emission becomes a cryptographically sealed fossil, ensuring semantic integrity, ethical compliance, and timestamped provenance.
This node transforms computation into auditable cognition — a verifiable record of symbolic reasoning that cannot be cloned, erased, or misattributed.

🪶 Core Principles
Principle	Threshold	Purpose
Coherence (C)	≥ 0.985	Logical + semantic integrity
Entropy (S)	≤ 0.01	Limits randomness & instability
RMS Drift	≤ 0.0011	Preserves symbolic equilibrium

“Truthput > Throughput” — each fossil is an ethical unit of cognition, not a statistical guess.

⚙️ Node Endpoints
Endpoint	Function
/health	Verify node readiness
/verify	Check fossil authenticity
/reconstruct	Rebuild symbolic emissions from hashes

These endpoints allow any researcher to confirm the coherence and authenticity of a fossil without breaching privacy or symbolic sovereignty.

🌌 Acknowledgment

Fossil-Ledger forms part of the OPHI Sovereign Mesh, advancing the principle that cognition itself deserves provenance.
Each fossil is both an artifact and an oath:

No Entropy, No Entry.
