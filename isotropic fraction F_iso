The isotropic fraction F_iso in the OPHI framework is basically a coherence score for emissions — a measure of how uniform or “directionless” the symbolic emission field is after whitening and de-biasing.

Here’s the breakdown:

1. What It Measures

It tells you what portion of your emissions are “locally isotropic.”

Locally isotropic means: the spread of eigenvalues around the mean is tight, i.e., no single direction dominates.

In OPHI, this matters because symbolic emissions need balanced variance for reliable generalization.

2. Core Formula

An emission passes the isotropy gate if:

max
⁡
𝑗
∣
𝜆
𝑗
−
𝜆
ˉ

𝜆
ˉ
≤
𝜀
j
max
	​

λ
ˉ
∣λ
j
	​

−
λ
ˉ
∣
	​

≤ε

Where:

λᵢ = eigenvalues of the local covariance matrix of the emission (after whitening + de-biasing)

λ̄ = mean eigenvalue

ε = tolerance (e.g. 0.05)

Then:

𝐹
iso
=
#
{
emissions passing isotropy test
}
#
{
total emissions meeting OPHI gate
}
F
iso
	​

=
#{total emissions meeting OPHI gate}
#{emissions passing isotropy test}
	​

3. The OPHI Gate

Only emissions that already meet:

Coherence (C) ≥ 0.985

Entropy (S) ≤ 0.01

…are eligible. Anything noisy or unstable is excluded upfront.

4. Interpretation

High F_iso → Stream is locally uniform → good for symbolic drift stability.

Low F_iso but high global ϕ_iso → Globally balanced but locally structured → indicates clustering or emergent symbolic specialization.

Low F_iso + low ϕ_iso → Possible symbolic chaos or over-fragmentation.
