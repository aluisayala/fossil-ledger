🛠️ SE-44 Omega Resolver

**Purpose**: A CLI tool for identifying and resolving legacy code issues using mathematically derived entropy scores.

### 🔧 How It Works
- Scans legacy code modules.
- Computes an **Ω score** using measurable traits: complexity, resistance to change, redundancy, and depth.
- Outputs suggestions to clean up messy, outdated code.

### 🧮 Math Behind Ω

**Entropy Formula**:
$$
H = w_1 \cdot C + w_2 \cdot M + w_3 \cdot D + w_4 \cdot R
$$

**Omega Score**:
$$
\Omega = 800 - 7.3 \cdot H
$$

Where:
- \( C \) = Cyclomatic complexity  
- \( M \) = Mutation resistance  
- \( D \) = Dependency depth  
- \( R \) = Redundancy  
- \( H \) = Entropy score  
- Ω = cleanliness score (higher is better)
