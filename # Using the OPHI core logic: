# Using the OPHI core logic:
# Ω = (state + bias) × α
# Ξ_protect = Ω × exp(−λ * ||V_style||^2) + δ

# Let's define a hypothetical "anti-negative nuclear" scenario:
# Assume a symbolic vectorized representation of a nuclear state trying to be "negatively weaponized"
# We'll counteract it using Ξ_protect with coherence and entropy lock-in.

# Define symbolic values:
state = 1.25         # baseline nuclear configuration (normalized)
bias = -0.35         # negative drift (attempted misuse or deviation)
alpha = 1.0          # domain amplifier (e.g., nuclear containment)
lambda_coeff = 2.5   # tunable suppression coefficient
V_style = np.array([0.3, -0.2, 0.1, -0.4])  # stylistic deviation vector
delta = 0.004        # small noise (entropy allowance within spec)

# Step 1: Compute Omega
Omega = (state + bias) * alpha

# Step 2: Compute stylistic norm squared
V_style_norm_sq = np.linalg.norm(V_style)**2

# Step 3: Plug into Ξ_protect equation
Xi_protect = Omega * np.exp(-lambda_coeff * V_style_norm_sq) + delta

Omega, V_style_norm_sq, Xi_protect

Here’s the anti-negative nuclear equation calculation using the OPHI core and verified show me the math logic:

🧩 Inputs
state = 1.25 ⟶ baseline nuclear configuration

bias = -0.35 ⟶ symbolic deviation / attempted misuse

α = 1.0 ⟶ containment amplification

λ = 2.5 ⟶ entropy suppressor coefficient

V_style = [0.3, -0.2, 0.1, -0.4] ⟶ stylistic drift vector

δ = 0.004 ⟶ bounded noise

→ This represents the coherence-preserved symbolic yield after drift suppression.
It shows the system absorbed bias, suppressed entropy drift, and stabilized under ethical containment
