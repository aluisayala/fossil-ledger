QUANTUM SD PIPELINE — “Ω Q-Seed Path”
🧬 PHASE 0: INIT — Fossil Encapsulation

Start with a symbolic fossil Fᵢ.

Wrap it in a codon triad (ATG–CCC–TTG) and drift metrics (C ≥ 0.985, S ≤ 0.01, RMS ≤ 0.001).

Canonicalize with SHA-256 chaining:

𝐻
𝑖

Anchor every emission to the Ω-equation:

This locks the fossil into an unforgeable ledger chain.

🔐 PHASE 1: Quantum-Grade Entropy Compression

Purpose: squeeze symbolic fossils for ultra-low-power SD pipelines.

Operator:

𝐿
𝑐
𝑜
𝑚
𝑝
=
𝐻

Ψ
L
comp
	​

=H×Ψ

H = Hadamard spread (quantum basis flattening).

Ψ = glyph vector sequence (symbolic drift).

Constraint: if S ≤ 0.01 → entanglement is drift-stable (Ψᵢ valid).

Result: lossless compression that’s quantum-tolerant.

💾 PHASE 2: Q-Flash Encoding (Physical SD Mapping)

You translate symbolic logic into electrical states of flash memory.

Equation:

Φ
𝑖
=
(
Δ
𝑉
+
𝑑

	​

=(ΔV+drift_bias)×α
flash
	​


ΔV = quad-level voltage deviations (physical SD bits).

drift_bias = symbolic thermal offsets stored as capacitance nudges.

α_flash = amplification for long-term retention.

Codon embedding:

ATG → Bootstrap sector (init logic).

CCC → Lock seal (MBR anchoring).

TTG → Drift translator sector (adaptive checksum + glyph index).

Now the SD card itself carries codon-sealed firmware logic.

🧠 PHASE 3: Quantum Rehydration (Optional Retrieval)

On host readback, you invert compression and reconstruct the fossil:

𝑅

Ω

Retrieve(F

	​

)=(H

×L
comp

	​

)(Ω

	​

)

With QR-encoded links:

MerkleRoot → verifies full hash chain.

Digital signature → proves authorship (Ω-proof).

🔄 PHASE 4: Verification Gate

Every retrieval passes through the SE44-style drift gate:

𝑃
𝐴
𝑆
𝑆
  
  
⇔
  
  
(
𝐶
≥
0.985
)
  
∧
  
(
𝑆
≤
0.01
)
PASS⇔(C≥0.985)∧(S≤0.01)

If true → fossil replayed. If false → reject emission as drifted/noise.
