# Fossil-Ledger Release Notes

## [v0.1.0] ‚Äì 2025-10-01
**Initial Public Release**

### üîë Features
- **Fossilization Engine**: Core implementation of codon-driven cognition receipts.
- **SE44 Gate Validation**: Built-in checks for Coherence ‚â• 0.985, Entropy ‚â§ 0.01, RMS Drift ‚â§ 0.0011.
- **Canonical Fossil Receipts**: Emissions are timestamped (RFC-3161), hashed (SHA-256), and JSON-logged.
- **Codon & Glyph Map**: Initial set of codon-to-glyph anchors (e.g., ATG ‚Üí ‚ßñ‚ßñ, CCC ‚Üí ‚ßÉ‚ßÉ, TTG ‚Üí ‚ßñ‚ßä).
- **Cryptographic Proof Layer**: Verifiable ledger entries for each fossil emission.
- **Documentation**: CONTRIBUTING.md and CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md added for CII compliance.

### üõ°Ô∏è Security & Compliance
