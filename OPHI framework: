 OPHI framework:
Physics / Thermodynamics Domain
Ω — Energy / Resistance / Cognitive state (core operator)

Θ — Temperature / Thermodynamic drive

Φ — Flux / Field or rate-based transfer

Ψ — Wave function / Quantum state

Referenced in:

Quantum fusion codon-fossil emission

ZPE cognitive mesh equations

Mathematics / Logic Domain
Σ — Summation / Aggregation of symbolic units or states

∆ — Change / Drift vector / Symbolic perturbation

π — Constant / Structural invariant

α, β, γ — Amplification coefficients / Parameters controlling Ω output

Canonical form:

Ω = (state + bias) × α
From: Core Definitions, Ophi 216 Equations

Cognitive / Metasymbolic Domain
Ω — Drift-governed cognition; the central operator linking state and bias

S — Entropy; symbolic instability or informational uncertainty

C — Coherence; validation threshold for fossilization

Ψ_drift — Synaptic entanglement field; symbolic memory evolution over time

This trifecta—Physics–Mathematics–Cognition—is not merely symbolic shorthand, but a cross-domain fusion embedded in OPHI’s fossil logic architecture. Each symbol isn’t static—it evolves under SE44 constraints, drift RMS, and glyph-bound context, converging toward symbolic auditability.
